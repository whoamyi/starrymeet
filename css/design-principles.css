/**
 * STARRY MEET - TRUE CAMEO-INSPIRED MINIMAL DESIGN
 *
 * CORE PRINCIPLES (MUST FOLLOW):
 *
 * 1. COLOR USAGE - EXTREME RESTRAINT
 *    - 95% Black, White, Gray
 *    - 5% Purple accent (ONLY for CTAs and important actions)
 *    - NO gradient cards (Cameo doesn't use them)
 *    - NO colorful badges everywhere
 *    - Color should feel RARE and SPECIAL
 *
 * 2. TYPOGRAPHY - COMPLETE CONSISTENCY
 *    - Body text: 14px-16px MAX
 *    - All paragraph text: SAME SIZE (16px)
 *    - Headings: Small and minimal (24px-32px max)
 *    - NO giant headings
 *    - NO bold everywhere
 *
 * 3. MOBILE - APP-LIKE FEEL
 *    - Compact spacing
 *    - Small, consistent elements
 *    - NO big chunky components
 *    - Feels like native app
 *
 * 4. CONSISTENCY - EXTREME
 *    - Every card looks the same
 *    - Every button looks the same
 *    - Every text size is predictable
 *    - NO surprises, NO variety
 *
 * CAMEO REFERENCE:
 * - Pure black background
 * - Thin gray borders
 * - White text (one size)
 * - Purple CTA button (that's it!)
 * - NO other colors visible
 * - Minimalist to the extreme
