# Part 1: Brand Foundation

## 1.1 Brand Positioning

### Core Positioning Statement
**"StarryMeet is where unforgettable moments happen—connecting you face-to-face with the people who inspire you."**

### Strategic Positioning
StarryMeet is not a booking platform. We are not a marketplace. We are not a scheduling service.

**We are an experience architect for life-defining moments.**

We create the rarest and most valuable connection possible: physical presence with someone who has shaped your life, dreams, or aspirations.

### Positioning Pillars

#### 1. Premium Over Volume
- We facilitate exceptional experiences, not transactions
- Quality, not quantity
- Curated, not catalog
- Exclusive, not endless

#### 2. Trust Over Speed
- Safety is paramount for both fans and celebrities
- Verification is rigorous, not perfunctory
- Every detail matters because physical safety matters
- Trust is earned through transparency and protection

#### 3. Moments Over Meetings
- We sell life-changing experiences, not minutes
- Anticipation is part of the value
- Memory creation is the product
- Emotional transformation is the outcome

#### 4. Human Over Digital
- Physical presence cannot be replicated digitally
- In-person connection creates deeper bonds
- Real-world logistics reflect real-world value
- Location-based features honor geographic authenticity

## 1.3 Market Differentiation

### vs. Cameo (Video Messages)
- **Physical vs. Digital**: Real presence, not screen distance
- **Moment vs. Message**: Life event, not content consumption
- **Premium vs. Accessible**: Higher value, justified higher price
- **Exclusive vs. Available**: Scarcity creates significance

### vs. Meet & Greets (Event-Based)
- **Personal vs. Public**: Private moments, not crowd experiences
- **Convenient vs. Chaotic**: Calm logistics, not event chaos
- **Meaningful vs. Rushed**: Quality time, not brief encounters
- **Safe vs. Uncertain**: Verified environments, not unpredictable settings

### vs. Booking Agencies (Traditional)
- **Modern vs. Antiquated**: Digital-first, not phone/email chains

# Part 2: Brand Personality

## 2.1 Core Personality Traits

### 1. Sophisticated
**Not:** Pretentious, cold, inaccessible
**But:** Refined, elegant, premium

**Manifests As:**
- Visual restraint (black primary, accent colors used sparingly)
- Thoughtful language (no hype, no urgency tactics)
- Polished experiences (every detail considered)
- Confidence without arrogance

**Why:** Physical meetings are premium experiences. Our brand must match the value we provide.

### 2. Trustworthy
**Not:** Corporate, sterile, bureaucratic
**But:** Reliable, transparent, protective

**Manifests As:**
- Clear communication (no hidden fees, no surprises)
- Safety emphasis (verification badges, location details, policies)
- Honest language (realistic expectations, not overselling)
- Consistent delivery (promises kept, experiences honored)

**Why:** We handle physical meetings between strangers. Trust is not optional—it's existential.

### 3. Transformative
**Not:** Transactional, commoditized, ordinary
**But:** Meaningful, memorable, life-changing

**Manifests As:**
- Emotional language (focus on moments, not meetings)
- Storytelling emphasis (user stories, testimonials, journeys)
- Experience framing (before/during/after narrative)
- Legacy thinking (this moment will matter forever)

**Why:** Our product creates memories that last lifetimes. We honor that significance.

### 4. Exclusive

**Better:** "Spend half an hour with your hero. From $500."

**Better:** "Meet Oscar-winning actors, Olympic athletes, and Billboard chart-toppers."
**Best:** "Meet the actor who made you cry, the athlete who inspired you to compete, the musician who soundtracked your life."

**Best:** "We verify identities, inspect locations, and provide 24/7 support. You're protected at every step."

#### 7. Scarcity Without Urgency
**Poor:** "Only 3 slots left! Book now!"
**Better:** "Limited availability remaining."
**Best:** "Few moments this intimate are available. Reserve yours while you can."

#### 8. Sophistication Through Restraint
**Poor:** "This is AMAZING! You'll LOVE IT! So EXCITING!!!"
**Better:** "This is remarkable. You'll treasure it. It's genuinely exciting."
**Best:** "This matters. You'll remember it forever. That's not hyperbole—it's truth."

# Part 4: Visual Brand System

## 4.1 Color Philosophy

### Strategic Approach: Sophisticated Restraint
**Principle:** "Luxury whispers; cheapness shouts."

Our color system is built on confidence through restraint:
- **Black dominates** - Creates premium canvas, lets celebrities shine
- **Accents enhance** - Used strategically, never decoratively
- **White space breathes** - Negative space = sophistication

### The "90/10 Rule"
**Cameo uses 80/20. We use 90/10.**

**Why:** Physical meetings are more premium than videos. More restraint = more luxury.

- **90%** - Black, white, subtle grays
- **10%** - Color accents (pink, purple, cyan, gold)

**Application:**
- Any given screen should be mostly black with white text
- Color appears in specific, intentional moments
- Gradients used even more sparingly than solid colors

---

## 4.2 Color System

### Foundation Colors

#### Pure Black
- **HEX:** #000000
- **Usage:** Primary background (90% of all backgrounds)
- **Psychology:** Sophistication, premium, timeless, focus
- **Why:** Creates theater-like environment—attention on the star

#### Pure White
- **HEX:** #FFFFFF
- **Usage:** Primary text, key UI elements, negative space
- **Psychology:** Clarity, honesty, purity, simplicity
- **Why:** Maximum contrast = maximum readability and sophistication

#### Grays (Hierarchy)
- **Light Gray:** #E5E5E5 - Borders on white backgrounds (rare)
- **Medium Gray:** #B0B0B0 - Secondary text on black
- **Dark Gray:** #808080 - Tertiary text, subtle labels
- **Deeper Gray:** #505050 - Muted text, disabled states

**Usage Rules:**
- Grays create hierarchy without adding color noise
- Never use grays for primary content
- Reserve darkest grays for least important content

## 4.3 Typography System

### Font Philosophy
**"Type should be invisible until it needs to be seen."**

Typography creates hierarchy, communicates personality, and ensures readability. It should never call attention to itself—only to the content it carries.

### Font Families

#### Primary: Inter (Sans-Serif)
**Usage:** 95% of all text
**Weights:** 400 (Regular), 500 (Medium), 600 (Semibold), 700 (Bold), 800 (Extrabold)

**Why Inter:**
- Designed for screens (exceptional readability at all sizes)
- Modern and sophisticated without being trendy
- Extensive weight range allows subtle hierarchy
- Works beautifully at both display and body sizes
- Open-source and web-optimized
- Neutral enough to let content shine

**Character Traits:**
- Tall x-height (readable at small sizes)
- Open apertures (clarity on screens)
- Distinctive but not quirky
- Professional without being corporate

#### Secondary: Playfair Display (Serif)
**Usage:** <5% of text—decorative moments only
**Weights:** 400 (Regular), 700 (Bold)

**Why Playfair Display:**
- Elegant and sophisticated for special moments
- High contrast (visual interest)
- Pairs beautifully with Inter
- Reserved for high-impact headlines or quotes

**When to Use:**
- Optional for major homepage headline
- Optional for about page hero text
- Sparingly in editorial content
- Never for UI elements, buttons, or functional text

**When NOT to Use:**
- Body copy (hard to read at length)
- Small text (loses clarity)
- Functional UI (too decorative)
- Any text under 24px

---

### Type Scale

#### Philosophy
**Restrained sizing with clear hierarchy.**

Smaller than typical modern web design = sophistication and confidence.

```

## 4.4 Spatial System

### Philosophy: "Breathing Room = Premium"

Luxury products have space. Budget products are cramped. Our spacing system reflects our premium positioning.

### Spacing Scale (8px Base Unit)

**Why 8px:**
- Divisible by 2 (responsive scaling)
- Common browser default
- Works well for touch targets (48px = 6 units)
- Industry standard

```
--space-1:  4px    (0.5 units)  - Hairline spacing
--space-2:  8px    (1 unit)     - Tight spacing
--space-3:  12px   (1.5 units)  - Small gaps
--space-4:  16px   (2 units)    - Default spacing
--space-6:  24px   (3 units)    - Comfortable spacing
--space-8:  32px   (4 units)    - Generous spacing
--space-12: 48px   (6 units)    - Section spacing
--space-16: 64px   (8 units)    - Large section spacing
--space-20: 80px   (10 units)   - Major section breaks
--space-24: 96px   (12 units)   - Page section breaks
--space-32: 128px  (16 units)   - Hero spacing (rare)
```

- Desktop: 24px → Mobile: 16px

---

### Spatial Rules

#### DO:
✅ Use more space than feels necessary (confidence)
✅ Maintain consistent spacing within components
✅ Scale spacing proportionally on mobile
✅ Use larger spacing for premium features
✅ Let hero sections breathe with generous spacing
✅ Group related elements with tighter spacing
✅ Separate unrelated elements with generous spacing

#### DON'T:
❌ Cram elements together (feels cheap)
❌ Use random spacing values (breaks system)
❌ Make mobile spacing too tight (uncomfortable)
❌ Use same spacing for all hierarchy levels
❌ Forget that whitespace is a design element
❌ Fill every pixel (emptiness = luxury)

## 4.5 Component Design Principles

### Philosophy: "Invisible Until Interacted With"

Our UI should fade into the background, letting celebrities and content shine. Components should be functional, not decorative.

---

### Button Design

#### Primary Button (Main CTAs)
**Visual:**
- Background: Purple gradient (#A78BFA to #8B5CF6)
- Text: White, Semibold (600), 16px
- Border-radius: Full (pill shape)
- Padding: 12px 32px
- Shadow: None (default), purple glow on hover

**Behavior:**
- Hover: Lift 3px + subtle purple glow
- Active: Lift 1px (pressed feel)
- Disabled: 40% opacity, no hover effects

**Usage:**
- Maximum 1-2 per screen
- Reserve for highest-priority actions
- "Reserve Your Moment," "Request Meeting," "Complete Booking"

**Why This Design:**
- Gradient = premium without being loud
- Pill shape = modern, friendly, approachable
- Purple = premium brand color
- No default shadow = clean, confident

#### Secondary Button (Alternative Actions)
**Visual:**
- Background: Transparent
- Text: Purple (#8B5CF6), Semibold (600), 16px
- Border: 2px solid Purple
- Border-radius: Full
- Padding: 12px 32px

**Behavior:**
- Hover: Fill with purple, text turns white, lift 2px
- Active: Slight scale down (0.98)

**Usage:**
- 2-3 per screen acceptable
- Secondary actions: "Learn More," "View Profile," "Browse Categories"

#### Tertiary Button (Low-Priority Actions)
**Visual:**
- Background: Transparent
- Text: Medium Gray (#B0B0B0), Medium (500), 16px
- Border: None
- Padding: 12px 24px

**Behavior:**
- Hover: Text turns white, subtle underline
- No lift or shadow (minimal emphasis)

**Usage:**
- Low-priority actions: "Cancel," "Go Back," "Skip"

---

### Card Design

#### Standard Card (Default)
**Visual:**
- Background: Pure black (#000000)
- Border: 1px solid rgba(139, 92, 246, 0.12) (subtle purple tint)
- Border-radius: 16px (rounded but not pill)
- Padding: 24px
- Shadow: None (default)

**Behavior:**
- Hover: Lift 4px, border brightens to rgba(139, 92, 246, 0.2), subtle purple glow
- Click: Lift 2px (if clickable)

**Usage:**
- Celebrity profile cards
- Information containers
- Content blocks

**Why:**
- Black maintains sophistication
- Subtle purple border connects to brand
- Lift on hover = interactive affordance
- 16px radius = modern but not trendy

#### Gradient Card (Emphasis - RARE)
**Visual:**
- Background: Gradient (pink, purple, cyan, or gold)
- Border: None
- Border-radius: 16px
- Padding: 24px
- Text: Always white
- Shadow: None (default)

**Behavior:**
- Hover: Lift 6px, enhanced glow in gradient color

**Usage:**
- ONLY for major emphasis: featured celebrities, premium tiers, special categories
- Maximum 2-3 visible per screen
- Never for standard content

**Available Gradients:**
- Pink (passion/emotion)
- Purple (premium/luxury)
- Cyan (trust/safety)
- Gold (excellence/VIP)

**Why Rare:**
- Overuse cheapens the effect
- Most content doesn't need this level of emphasis
- Scarcity = special feeling

---

### Badge Design

#### Verified Badge (Trust Indicator)
**Visual:**
- Background: Cyan gradient (#22D3EE to #06B6D4)
- Text: White, Extrabold (800), 10px
- Text-transform: Uppercase
- Letter-spacing: 0.05em
- Padding: 4px 8px
- Border-radius: Full (pill)
- Icon: Checkmark (✓) before text
- Shadow: Subtle cyan glow

**Usage:**
- Celebrity profiles (verified identity)
- Location listings (verified addresses)
- Any trust/safety indicator

**Why Cyan:**
- Blue psychology = trust
- Cyan = modern twist on traditional blue
- Stands out without competing with primary CTAs

#### Premium Badge (VIP Indicator)
**Visual:**
- Background: Gold gradient (#F59E0B to #FCD34D)
- Text: White, Extrabold (800), 10px
- Text-transform: Uppercase
- Letter-spacing: 0.05em
- Padding: 4px 8px
- Border-radius: Full
- Icon: Star (★) before text
- Shadow: Subtle gold glow

#### Category Badge (Classification)
**Visual:**
- Background: Transparent
- Text: Medium Gray (#B0B0B0), Semibold (600), 12px
- Border: 1px solid rgba(176, 176, 176, 0.2)
- Border-radius: Full
- Padding: 4px 12px

**Usage:**
- Content categorization: "Actor," "Athlete," "Musician"
- Filters and tags
- Non-critical metadata

---

### Form Design

#### Input Fields
**Visual:**
- Background: Pure black (#000000)
- Border: 1px solid rgba(139, 92, 246, 0.12)
- Border-radius: 12px
- Padding: 16px

- Error: Border becomes red (#EF4444), red glow
- Success: Border becomes cyan (#06B6D4), cyan glow
- Disabled: Border becomes Deeper Gray, 60% opacity

**Why:**
- Black background = consistency with overall design

#### Labels
**Visual:**
- Text: Medium Gray (#B0B0B0), Semibold (600), 14px

- Slides in from right
- Full-screen overlay
- Background: Pure black (#000000)
- Blur backdrop

**Why:**
- Full-screen = focus on navigation
- Slide-in = smooth, expected pattern
- Black = maintains sophistication

---

## 4.6 Layout Principles

### Grid System
- **Desktop:** 12-column grid
- **Tablet:** 8-column grid
- **Mobile:** 4-column grid
- **Gutter:** 24px (desktop), 16px (mobile)

### Content Hierarchy
1. **Hero section:** Full-width, 80vh minimum height, centered content
2. **Primary content:** Max 1280px wide, centered
3. **Supporting content:** Max 960px wide for text-heavy sections
4. **Full-bleed sections:** Strategic use for visual impact

### Responsive Strategy
- **Mobile-first:** Design for mobile, enhance for desktop
- **Breakpoints:** 640px (mobile), 768px (tablet), 1024px (desktop), 1280px (large desktop)
- **Fluid typography:** Text scales between breakpoints
- **Flexible layouts:** Grid columns collapse gracefully

---

# Part 5: Content Strategy

## 5.1 Content Pillars

### 1. Trust & Safety
**Why:** Physical meetings require extreme trust
**Content Focus:** Verification processes, safety policies, location vetting, support availability
**Tone:** Professional, protective, reassuring

### 2. Experience Quality
**Why:** We sell transformative moments, not transactions
**Content Focus:** Meeting experience details, preparation guides, what to expect, success stories
**Tone:** Inspiring, detailed, anticipatory

### 3. Exclusivity & Access
**Why:** Scarcity creates value
**Content Focus:** Limited availability, curated celebrities, VIP features, exclusive opportunities
**Tone:** Elevated, invitational, special

### 4. User Empowerment
**Why:** Meeting your hero is intimidating—we make it possible
**Content Focus:** How it works, FAQs, preparation tips, confidence building
**Tone:** Supportive, clear, encouraging

---

## 5.2 Content Rules

### Headlines
- **Lead with benefit**, not feature: "Meet Your Hero" not "Celebrity Booking Platform"
- **Create anticipation**: Use "your moment," "your meeting," "your experience"
- **Be specific**: "30 minutes with an Oscar winner" beats "celebrity meetings"
- **Avoid hype**: Confidence doesn't need exclamation points

### Body Copy
- **Short paragraphs**: 2-3 sentences maximum
- **Scannable**: Use bullets, subheads, visual breaks
- **Active voice**: "Reserve your moment" not "Moments can be reserved"
- **Second person**: "You'll meet" not "Users meet"

### CTAs
- **Action-oriented**: Verbs first ("Reserve," "Discover," "Request")
- **Value-focused**: "Reserve Your Moment" not "Click Here"
- **Context-specific**: "Meet This Star" not "Learn More"
- **Singular focus**: One primary CTA per section

### Trust Indicators
- **Specific numbers**: "Identity verification in 5 steps" not "Thorough verification"
- **Transparent processes**: Explain how things work
- **Social proof**: Real testimonials, specific stories
- **Safety emphasis**: Always visible, never hidden

---

## 5.3 Storytelling Framework

### User Journey Narrative

#### Act 1: The Dream
**Content:** You've always wanted to meet this person
**Emotion:** Longing, doubt ("Is this possible?")
**Our Role:** Show it's possible

#### Act 2: The Path
**Content:** Here's exactly how to make it happen
**Emotion:** Hope, excitement, nervousness
**Our Role:** Guide and reassure

#### Act 3: The Moment
**Content:** You're in the room with your hero
**Emotion:** Awe, presence, transformation
**Our Role:** Invisible enabler

#### Act 4: The Memory
**Content:** This moment changed your life
**Emotion:** Gratitude, fulfillment
**Our Role:** Memory keeper

### Story Elements in Content
- **User testimonials:** Focus on emotional transformation, not just "met celebrity"
- **Celebrity perspectives:** Why they value these intimate meetings
- **Behind-the-scenes:** Show verification, vetting, preparation (builds trust)
- **Moment descriptions:** Paint vivid picture of what meeting feels like

---

# Part 6: Photography & Imagery

## 6.1 Photography Principles

### Philosophy: "Authentic Humanity"

We don't need overly-styled photoshoots. We need real moments that feel genuine, intimate, and transformative.

### Image Characteristics

#### Celebrity Portraits
- **Style:** Natural, authentic, high-quality
- **Composition:** Headshots or upper body, clear facial features
- **Lighting:** Flattering but not overly retouched
- **Background:** Neutral or subtly blurred (focus on face)
- **Treatment:** Full color OR black-and-white (for consistency across diverse source photos)
- **NO:** Paparazzi shots, party photos, overly-edited glamour shots

**Why:**
- Users need to recognize the celebrity
- Authentic representation builds trust
- Professional quality reflects premium positioning
- B&W option creates consistency when source photos vary

#### Meeting Moments (When Available)
- **Style:** Genuine, candid, emotional
- **Composition:** Celebrity + fan together, showing interaction
- **Focus:** Real emotion, not posed photos
- **Privacy:** Always obtain consent before using

**Why:**
- Social proof—seeing real meetings builds trust
- Emotional connection—users see themselves in these moments
- Authenticity—staged photos feel fake

#### UI Supporting Images
- **Minimal use:** Content (celebrities) should be the imagery
- **When needed:** Abstract, subtle, don't compete with celebrities
- **Style:** Dark, minimal, geometric if used

**Why:**
- Celebrity photos are our primary visual content
- Extra imagery clutters and cheapens
- Restraint = sophistication

---

## 6.2 Image Treatment

### Color Treatment
- **Primary:** Full color (when source photo is high-quality and consistent)
- **Alternative:** Black and white (when color photos clash or quality varies)
- **Mixed approach:** Acceptable—some B&W, some color based on quality

### Consistency Rules
- All celebrity photos should feel like they belong to same collection
- If color photos have wildly different lighting/quality, convert to B&W
- Maintain same aspect ratio for same context (all profile cards same ratio)
- Consistent cropping (all headshots cropped similarly)

### Technical Specs
- **Format:** WebP (with JPG fallback)
- **Quality:** High—don't compress celebrities into pixelation
- **Lazy loading:** Yes, but eager load above-the-fold
- **Alt text:** Descriptive and specific: "Actor John Doe smiling in professional headshot"

---

# Part 7: Iconography & Visual Elements

## 7.1 Icon Style

### Characteristics
- **Style:** Outline (not filled)
- **Weight:** 2px stroke
- **Corners:** Rounded (matches overall brand softness)
- **Size:** 24px default (scale proportionally)
- **Color:** Inherit from text (usually Medium Gray or White)

### Icon Library
**Recommended:** Heroicons, Lucide, or similar outline-style systems

**Why:**
- Outline icons feel modern and lightweight
- 2px stroke maintains visibility without heaviness
- Consistent style across all icons

### Usage Rules
- Icons always accompany text (don't rely on icons alone)
- Color matches adjacent text for hierarchy
- Hover states inherit interaction color (purple)
- Decorative icons should be rare

---

## 7.2 Logo Design (StarryMeet)

### Logo Characteristics
**Primary Logo:**
- Wordmark: "StarryMeet"
- Likely includes star motif (subtle, not clip-art)
- Modern sans-serif (likely Inter or custom)
- Available in: White (primary), Purple (on light backgrounds), Black (rarely)

### Logo Usage Rules
- **Clear space:** Minimum equal to height of one letter
- **Minimum size:** 100px wide (digital), 0.5 inch (print)
- **Primary use:** White on black
- **Do NOT:** Stretch, add effects, change colors beyond specified, rotate

### Icon/Mark Version
- Abbreviated "SM" or star symbol
- Used for: App icon, favicon, small spaces
- Never in primary navigation (use full logo)

---

# Part 8: Motion & Interaction

## 8.1 Animation Philosophy

**"Motion should feel like breathing—natural, subtle, purposeful."**

Animation serves three purposes:
1. **Feedback** - Confirming user actions
2. **Guidance** - Directing attention
3. **Delight** - Creating premium feel

Animation should NEVER:
- Delay user actions
- Cause distraction
- Feel gimmicky
- Be disabled in motion-reduced settings

---

## 8.2 Animation Principles

### Timing
- **Fast:** 150ms - Micro-interactions (button hover, focus states)
- **Medium:** 250ms - Standard transitions (card hover, menu open)
- **Slow:** 350ms - Large movements (modal open, page transitions)
- **Very Slow:** 500ms - Special moments (success confirmations, dramatic reveals)

### Easing
- **Ease-out:** Default for most interactions (starts fast, ends slow - feels responsive)
- **Ease-in:** Exits (starts slow, gains speed - feels like it's leaving)
- **Ease-in-out:** Large movements (smooth start and end)
- **Bounce:** Rare - only for celebratory moments (booking confirmed)

### Movement Types

#### Lift (Elevation)
- **Use:** Buttons, cards on hover
- **Range:** 2-6px (subtle)
- **Timing:** 150-250ms ease-out
- **Why:** Creates tangible, premium feel

#### Scale
- **Use:** Icons, badges on hover
- **Range:** 1.0 to 1.05 (barely noticeable)
- **Timing:** 150ms ease-out
- **Why:** Subtle feedback without disruption

#### Fade
- **Use:** Element entrance/exit, modals
- **Range:** opacity 0 to 1
- **Timing:** 250ms ease-out (entrance), 200ms ease-in (exit)
- **Why:** Smooth, non-jarring transitions

#### Slide
- **Use:** Mobile menu, notifications, drawers
- **Direction:** Context-dependent (menus from right, notifications from top)
- **Timing:** 300ms ease-in-out
- **Why:** Spatial awareness—elements come from somewhere

---

## 8.3 Interaction States

### Buttons
- **Default:** No shadow, flat
- **Hover:** Lift 3px, subtle glow, 150ms
- **Active:** Lift 1px, scale 0.98, 100ms
- **Disabled:** 40% opacity, no interactions

### Cards
- **Default:** No shadow, subtle border
- **Hover:** Lift 4-6px, border brightens, subtle glow, 250ms
- **Active:** Lift 2px (if clickable)

### Links
- **Default:** Colored text (purple)
- **Hover:** Underline appears, 150ms
- **Active:** Color darkens slightly

### Inputs
- **Default:** Subtle border
- **Focus:** Border color changes, 3px glow appears, 200ms
- **Error:** Border becomes red, shake animation (subtle)
- **Success:** Border becomes cyan, subtle pulse

---

## 8.4 Page Transitions

### Philosophy
**Minimal disruption, maximum smoothness.**

### Between Pages
- **Fade:** Simple opacity transition, 200ms
- **NO:** Elaborate slide transitions (annoying for frequent use)

### Loading States
- **Skeleton screens:** Preferred over spinners
- **Color:** rgba(139, 92, 246, 0.1) (subtle purple)
- **Animation:** Pulse (1.5s loop, ease-in-out)
- **Why:** Maintains layout, reduces perceived wait time

### Scroll Behavior
- **Smooth scroll:** Enabled (CSS: scroll-behavior: smooth)
- **Snap points:** Only for carousels, not general scrolling
- **Parallax:** NO (overdone, performance issues, accessibility concerns)
