## üé® Design Principles (Current)

### 1. Extreme Typography Restraint
**24px is the largest text anywhere on the site.**

Why:
- Sophistication through understatement
- More restrained than typical modern web
- Confidence doesn't need large type

### 2. Near-Monochrome Palette
**95% of design is black/white/gray.**

Why:
- Celebrity photos are the color
- Restraint = luxury
- Purple CTA stands out more when surrounded by monochrome

### 3. Flat Design
**One background color everywhere (#0c0d0e).**

Why:
- No elevation complexity
- Consistent "dark paper" surface
- Shadows are extremely subtle (like a mirage)

### 4. App-Like Mobile
**Compact, tight spacing on mobile.**

Why:
- Feels native and polished
- Not chunky web design
- Respects small screens

### 5. Sans-Serif Only
**Inter exclusively. No decorative fonts.**

Why:
- Complete consistency
- Modern and clean
- Content speaks for itself

## üì± Responsive Strategy

### Breakpoints
```
Mobile:  < 768px   (tight spacing, smaller typography)
Tablet:  768-1024px (moderate spacing)
Desktop: > 1024px   (generous spacing)
```

### Mobile-First Approach
- Design starts mobile
- Enhanced progressively for larger screens
- Buttons 42px tall (not 48px)
- Tighter gaps and padding
- Logo 18px (not 24px)
