## Category Usage Statistics

To get celebrity counts per category, run:

```sql
SELECT
  c.name as category,
  c.parent_category,
  COUNT(cn.id) as total_celebrities
FROM categories c
LEFT JOIN celebrities_new cn ON c.id = cn.category_id
  AND cn.status = 'active'
GROUP BY c.id, c.name, c.parent_category
ORDER BY total_celebrities DESC;
```

## Notes

- Categories are hierarchical with parent groups for filtering
- Each celebrity can belong to only one category
- Slugs are URL-friendly versions for routing
- Parent categories help organize browse/filter UI
