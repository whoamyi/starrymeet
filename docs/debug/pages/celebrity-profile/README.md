## Availability System Architecture

```
Celebrity Data (celebrities.js)
  ↓
Profile Page Loads Celebrity
  ↓
Calculate Total Slots
  ├─ Iterate through all locations
  ├─ For each location, iterate through dates
  ├─ For each date, count available time slots
  └─ Sum all slots across locations/dates
  ↓
Display in Stats Section: "X slots available"
  ↓
Generate Calendar
  ├─ Filter dates with actual availability
  ├─ Add indicators only for available dates
  └─ Apply proper CSS classes
  ↓
Upcoming Availability Section
  ├─ Show locations with availability
  ├─ Show dates for each location
  └─ "Book Now" button with location context
  ↓
Click "Book Now"
  ↓ Pass: celebrity, location, date via URL
  ↓
booking.html
```

## Slot Counting Logic

```javascript
// Correct Implementation
let totalSlots = 0;
celebrity.locations.forEach(location => {
  location.availableDates.forEach(dateObj => {
    totalSlots += dateObj.timeSlots.length;
  });
});
```

**Key Points**:
- Count all slots across ALL locations
- Count all slots across ALL dates
- Don't just count first date's slots
- Filter out dates with zero slots
