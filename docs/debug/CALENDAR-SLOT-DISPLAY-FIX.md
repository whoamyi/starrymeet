# Calendar Slot Display Fix

**Date**: 2025-10-09
**Issue #39**: Calendar showing slot indicators for dates with no availability
**Status**: ✅ FIXED

---

## Problem Statement

User reported via screenshot: Calendar displaying green "slot" badges on dates even when console logs show "No slots for date: 2025-10-18 at Los Angeles, USA" (and subsequent dates).

### Observed Behavior

**Screenshot Evidence**:
- Calendar shows dates Oct 10-Oct 31 with green slot indicators (e.g., "1 slot", "3 slots")
- Console logs: "No slots for date: 2025-10-18 at Los Angeles, USA" through "2025-11-05"
- Inconsistency: Visual display contradicts availability data

**Console Output**:
```
Generating calendar for: { celebrity: 'Emma Watson', location: 'Los Angeles, USA' }
No slots for date: 2025-10-18 at Los Angeles, USA
No slots for date: 2025-10-19 at Los Angeles, USA
[... repeated for many dates ...]
Calendar generated: 17 dates with available slots
```

**Root Cause Identified**:
1. Calendar HTML was rendered with slot indicators
2. Location dropdown included locations without availability data
3. Slot indicator conditional logic wasn't strictly validating data
4. No debugging information showing which locations each celebrity actually has

---

## Solution Overview

### Fix 1: Stricter Slot Indicator Rendering

**Location**: `booking.html:2030-2037`

**Problem**: Slot indicator was being added based on single condition `if (slots && slots.availableSlots > 0)`

**Solution**: Added triple validation with explicit else clause:

```javascript
// Before
let slotIndicator = '';
if (slots && slots.availableSlots > 0) {
    slotIndicator = `<div class="slots-indicator">...</div>`;
}

// After
let slotIndicator = '';
if (hasSlots && slots && slots.availableSlots > 0) {
    slotIndicator = `<div class="slots-indicator">...</div>`;
} else {
    // Explicitly no indicator for dates without slots
    slotIndicator = '';
}
```

**Added** `data-has-slots` attribute to calendar days for debugging:
```html
<div class="calendar-day" data-has-slots="${hasSlots}" ...>
```

### Fix 2: Enhanced Availability Debug Logging

**Location**: `booking.html:1553-1586`

**Problem**: No visibility into which locations were being generated for each celebrity

**Solution**: Added comprehensive debug logging:

```javascript
// Log locations for each celebrity
console.log(`[DEBUG] ${celebrity.name} (index ${celebIndex}) will have availability at:`, locations);

// Log dates added per location
console.log(`[DEBUG]   ${location}: ${datesAdded} dates with availability`);
```

**Output Example**:
```
[DEBUG] Emma Watson (index 0) will have availability at: ['London, UK', 'Sydney, Australia', 'Los Angeles, USA']
[DEBUG]   London, UK: 18 dates with availability
[DEBUG]   Sydney, Australia: 18 dates with availability
[DEBUG]   Los Angeles, USA: 18 dates with availability
```

### Fix 3: Stricter Location Dropdown Validation

**Location**: `booking.html:1938-1952`

**Problem**: Pre-selected locations could be added to dropdown even if they had empty availability objects

**Solution**: Added date count validation:

```javascript
// Before
if (availabilityData[celebrityName][selectedLocation]) {
    locationsWithAvailability.push(selectedLocation);
}

// After
if (availabilityData[celebrityName][selectedLocation]) {
    const dates = Object.keys(availabilityData[celebrityName][selectedLocation]);
    if (dates.length > 0) {
        locationsWithAvailability.push(selectedLocation);
    } else {
        console.warn('Pre-selected location exists but has no dates:', selectedLocation);
    }
}
```

## Technical Analysis

### Why Calendar Showed Slots When None Existed

**Scenario Reconstruction**:

1. User loaded `booking.html?celebrity=Emma Watson&city=London&country=UK`
2. London was pre-selected (has availability)
3. Calendar generated successfully with slot indicators
4. User manually changed dropdown to "Los Angeles, USA"
5. Location change triggered calendar regeneration
6. Los Angeles had NO availability data (or empty availability object)
7. Calendar rendered without proper validation, showing stale/incorrect badges

**Validation Chain**:

| Check | Previous | Fixed |
|-------|----------|-------|
| `hasAvailableSlots()` | Returns true/false | ✅ Same |
| `getAvailableSlots()` | Returns slots or null | ✅ Same |
| Slot indicator condition | `if (slots && ...)` | `if (hasSlots && slots && ...)` |
| Empty availability check | None | Added `dates.length > 0` |
| Debug visibility | None | Full logging |

## Testing Instructions

### Manual Test

1. **Open booking page for Emma Watson**:
   ```
   booking.html?celebrity=Emma Watson&type=standard
   ```

2. **Open browser console** (F12 → Console)

3. **Check debug output**:
   ```
   [DEBUG] Emma Watson (index 0) will have availability at: [...]
   [DEBUG]   London, UK: 18 dates with availability
   [DEBUG]   Sydney, Australia: 18 dates with availability
   [DEBUG]   Los Angeles, USA: 18 dates with availability
   ```

4. **Verify calendar**:
   - Only dates with availability should have green badges
   - Dates without slots should appear grayed out (disabled)
   - No badges should appear on disabled dates

5. **Change location dropdown**:
   - Select different location
   - Console should log: "Location changed to: [location]"
   - Console should log: "✅ Calendar regenerated for location: [location]"
   - Calendar should update immediately
   - Only show badges for dates with actual availability

6. **Inspect calendar HTML**:
   - Right-click any date → Inspect
   - Check attributes:
     - `data-has-slots="true"` → Should have slot indicator
     - `data-has-slots="false"` → Should NOT have slot indicator
     - `data-available-slots="X"` → Should match badge text

### Automated Validation

```javascript
// In browser console
const days = document.querySelectorAll('.calendar-day');
let mismatchCount = 0;

days.forEach(day => {
    const hasSlots = day.getAttribute('data-has-slots') === 'true';
    const slotsIndicator = day.querySelector('.slots-indicator');
    const hasIndicator = slotsIndicator !== null;

    if (hasSlots !== hasIndicator) {
        console.error('MISMATCH:', {
            date: day.getAttribute('data-date'),
            hasSlots: hasSlots,
            hasIndicator: hasIndicator,
            element: day
        });
        mismatchCount++;
    }
});

console.log(`Validation complete: ${mismatchCount} mismatches found`);
// Expected: 0 mismatches
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### Console Output (Success)

```
[DEBUG] Emma Watson (index 0) will have availability at: ['London, UK', 'Sydney, Australia', 'Los Angeles, USA']
[DEBUG]   London, UK: 18 dates with availability
[DEBUG]   Sydney, Australia: 18 dates with availability
[DEBUG]   Los Angeles, USA: 18 dates with availability
Availability data generated: 8 celebrities
Found 3 locations with availability for Emma Watson: (3) ['London, UK', 'Los Angeles, USA', 'Sydney, Australia']
Booking page initialization complete
Pre-selected meeting type: standard
Generating calendar for: { celebrity: 'Emma Watson', location: 'London, UK' }
Calendar generated: 18 dates with available slots
```

**Key Points**:
- All 3 locations have 18 dates with availability ✅
- Calendar generates 18 dates (matches expectations) ✅
- No "No slots for date" errors ✅

### Console Output (Error - If Location Has No Data)

```
[DEBUG] Emma Watson (index 0) will have availability at: ['London, UK', 'Sydney, Australia', 'Los Angeles, USA']
[DEBUG]   London, UK: 18 dates with availability
[DEBUG]   Sydney, Australia: 0 dates with availability
[DEBUG]   Los Angeles, USA: 18 dates with availability
⚠️ Sydney, Australia has no availability - will not appear in dropdown
Found 2 locations with availability for Emma Watson: (2) ['London, UK', 'Los Angeles, USA']
```

**Key Points**:
- Debug logging shows Sydney has 0 dates ✅
- Dropdown only shows locations with dates ✅
- User cannot select Sydney from dropdown ✅

## Commit Message

```
fix: Prevent calendar from showing slot indicators without availability data

Problem:
- Calendar displayed green slot badges on dates even when availability data was null
- Console logged "No slots for date: ..." but calendar still showed slots
- Location dropdown included locations with no actual availability
- No debug visibility into which locations were generated

Solution:
1. Added stricter validation for slot indicator rendering
   - Now requires: hasSlots && slots && slots.availableSlots > 0
   - Explicit else clause sets slotIndicator = ''
   - Added data-has-slots attribute for debugging

2. Enhanced availability generation debugging
   - Logs which locations each celebrity will have
   - Shows date count per location
   - Helps identify availability generation issues

3. Stricter location dropdown filtering
   - Checks that location has dates (not just exists in data)
   - Warns if pre-selected location has empty availability

Result:
✅ Calendar only shows badges when data exists
✅ Better debugging for availability issues
✅ Location dropdown shows only valid locations
