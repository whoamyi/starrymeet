Claude, read carefully — this isn’t a suggestion; it’s a directive. You are being tasked to restructure and restyle the StarryMeet website so that it feels unified, premium, and consistent across every page, starting with the product card redesign and a global color and accent system update.

The goal is to make StarryMeet’s interface feel like a luxury dark-mode mobile app — sleek, tactile, and emotionally subtle. No improvisation. You follow structure, consistency, and hierarchy exactly as described.


---

1. Objective

Rebuild the product card component and update the global design system.
You must:

Replace every existing accent system with a new, three-tier gold accent system (hint, glow, CTA).

Create shared UI components (header, footer, navbar, body, background, and card container) that are globally consistent.

Ensure that every page inherits these base tokens and layout rules. Individual pages can vary in shade or composition, but structure, spacing, and motion must remain identical.

Implement a mirage-like accent experience — the user feels color presence but cannot name it.

Replace the term “slot” with the 🎟️ ticket icon for all user-facing availability references (only use the word "slot" in backend or admin contexts).



---

2. Visual Philosophy

90/10 rule: 90% deep neutral darks, 10% muted gold/platinum accents.

Luxury logic: depth over brightness; motion over static color; tactile glass instead of flat gradients.

Accents are emotional, not decorative. They exist in hints, not in saturation.

Typography hierarchy defines readability; spacing defines trust; motion defines quality.



---

3. Global Structure Rules

Treat the site like a set of A4 pages — same size, same margin and padding, only content changes.

Shared components (header, footer, navbar, body, background) must be extracted as global includes or React components (depending on architecture).

Global spacing tokens must govern all layout gaps, paddings, and margins.

No page should declare independent background or spacing values.

All CTAs, borders, and shadows use the same token references.

Maintain responsive consistency — mobile-first grid, unified breakpoints.



---

4. Global Token System

Use these tokens as the single source of truth across all files.
No inline colors, no custom hex codes in components.

:root {
  /* Base surfaces */
  --bg-page: #0D0D0F;
  --bg-panel: #151516;
  --surface-weak: rgba(255,255,255,0.02);
  --surface-strong: rgba(255,255,255,0.04);

  /* Typography */
  --text-primary: rgba(237,237,237,0.95);
  --text-secondary: rgba(165,165,165,0.9);
  --muted: rgba(165,165,165,0.6);

  /* Accent system (muted gold family) */
  --accent-base: #C5A873;
  --accent-cta: #D7B972;
  --accent-hint: rgba(197,168,115,0.09);
  --accent-glow: rgba(215,185,114,0.14);

  /* Borders & shadows */
  --border-weak: rgba(255,255,255,0.04);
  --border-strong: rgba(255,255,255,0.06);
  --shadow-1: 0 8px 20px rgba(0,0,0,0.55);
  --shadow-accent: 0 10px 28px rgba(197,168,115,0.08);

  /* Motion */
  --motion-curve: cubic-bezier(0.22, 1, 0.36, 1);
  --motion-duration: 0.3s;

  /* Spacing and radii */
  --pad-sm: 8px;
  --pad: 16px;
  --pad-lg: 24px;
  --radius-card: 22px;
  --radius-btn: 12px;

  /* Typography */
  --font-sans: "Inter", "SF Pro Display", sans-serif;
}

All colors, borders, shadows, and highlights must derive from these tokens.

5. Product Card Redesign

Purpose

The product card acts as a teaser to the celebrity profile — minimal information, strong emotion.
It must convey exclusivity and hint at interactivity without overwhelming the user.


---

Design and Layout

Structure:

+------------------------------------+
|  [ Portrait or Initials Area ]     |
|   🎟️  Favorite Icon (top right)    |
|------------------------------------|
|  Name                              |
|  Profession                        |
|  Availability Line (📍 + 🎟️ count) |
|  Price Badge                       |
+------------------------------------+

Do not display the celebrity’s country of origin.

Display only meeting location or meeting type (physical/virtual).

Profession replaces the “Other” field — it reflects the user’s category from the database.

Use the 🎟️ icon before ticket count for all references to availability.

The ticket icon replaces the word “slot” throughout the UI.



---

Styling and Behavior

Use this as CSS reference for implementation:

.card {
  width: 46%;
  margin: 2%;
  background: var(--surface-weak);
  border-radius: var(--radius-card);
  border: 1px solid var(--border-weak);
  box-shadow: var(--shadow-1);
  backdrop-filter: blur(8px);
  transition: transform var(--motion-duration) var(--motion-curve),
              box-shadow var(--motion-duration) var(--motion-curve);
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}

.card:hover {
  transform: translateY(-6px);
  box-shadow: var(--shadow-1), var(--shadow-accent);
}

.card__hero {
  flex: 0 0 58%;
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  position: relative;
  background: linear-gradient(145deg, rgba(255,255,255,0.02), rgba(255,255,255,0.01));
}

.card__initials {
  font-size: 28px;
  font-weight: 600;
  color: var(--text-primary);
  text-shadow: 0 2px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.6);
}

.card__fav {
  position: absolute;
  right: 12px;
  top: 12px;
  width: 38px;
  height: 38px;
  border-radius: 50%;
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  background: rgba(255,255,255,0.03);
  border: 1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.04);
}

.card__info {
  padding: var(--pad);
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  gap: 6px;
  background: linear-gradient(180deg, rgba(255,255,255,0.01), rgba(255,255,255,0.015));
}

.card__name {
  font-size: 18px;
  font-weight: 600;
  color: var(--text-primary);
}

.card__profession {
  font-size: 14px;
  color: var(--text-secondary);
}

.card__availability {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: space-between;
  margin-top: 4px;
  font-size: 13px;
  color: var(--text-secondary);
}

.card__availability span {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  gap: 6px;
}

.card__price {
  font-size: 16px;
  font-weight: 600;
  color: var(--accent-base);
  background: rgba(197,168,115,0.03);
  padding: 6px 10px;
  border-radius: 10px;
  border: 1px solid rgba(197,168,115,0.06);
}

Example Card Markup

<article class="card">
  <div class="card__hero">
    <div class="card__initials">KB</div>
    <button class="card__fav" title="Favorite">
      <!-- heart icon -->
    </button>
  </div>

  <div class="card__info">
    <div class="card__name">Kate Bush</div>
    <div class="card__profession">Singer</div>
    <div class="card__availability">
      <span>📍 Paris</span>
      <span>🎟️ 3</span>
    </div>
    <div class="card__price">$40,435+</div>
  </div>
</article>


---

6. Interaction and Motion

Use 0.3s ease-out motion for all animations (var(--motion-curve)).

On hover: raise card 6px, add shadow accent.

On tap: compress slightly (scale(0.97)).

Favorite icons glow softly on activation with var(--accent-glow).

CTAs use var(--accent-cta) for backgrounds and var(--accent-base) for text.



---

7. Implementation Strategy

To avoid styling inconsistencies and hallucinations:

1. Extract all color values from every stylesheet → replace with token variables.


2. Create a global _theme.css or theme.ts file that defines all shared variables.


3. Centralize layout templates: header, footer, navbar, and background should be imported across every page.


4. Reference global card and CTA classes — no page-level overrides unless scoped under .page__custom.


5. Audit gradient usage — delete rainbow backgrounds and replace with tokenized subtle gradients.


6. Batch update icons — every “slot” icon becomes 🎟️; adjust spacing in line height to match.


7. Refactor text hierarchy: all typography uses Inter with shared class utilities (e.g., .text-title, .text-secondary, .text-price).




---

8. Testing and Rollout

Run color contrast audits (WCAG 2.1 AA minimum).

Test mobile responsiveness on 360px–420px widths.

Verify glass and blur fallback (rgba base instead of backdrop-filter where unsupported).

Confirm all components pull their spacing, corner, and motion values from tokens.

Once complete, export a before/after design diff for review.
 

#celebrity profile design
 Here is a multi-layer collapsible structure for Profile page:


---

# Profile Page (Full Experience)

Goal: make the user feel like they’re unlocking layers of exclusivity — each click a little deeper into access.


---

1. Header section

Hero banner or high-quality portrait.

Name, role, short bio (2–3 lines max).

Key highlights: short badges like “UN Ambassador”, “Award-winning”, “Mentor”, etc.

Maybe a discreet “Follow” or “Add to wishlist” icon.



---

2. Availability Section – New Multi-Layer Structure

Level 1: Primary View (Collapsed)

This is what users see at first glance:

📍 Paris ............ 3 🎟️available
💻 Virtual .......... 2 🎟️ available

No price. No dates. Just the promise of possibility.


---

Level 2: Slot Units (Expands from clicking a line)

When the user taps “Paris – 3 slots available”, it expands into:

May 24 • 10: 00 AM • 30 min  ⬇️
May 25 • 3: 00 PM • 45 min  ⬇️
May 26 • 5: 00 PM • 20 min  ⬇️

Still no prices. Still elegant restraint.


---

Level 3: Price & CTA (Expands per slot)

Clicking one of those reveals:

$1, 200
[Request Meeting]

If slot unavailable → show subtle “Fully Booked” in muted grey instead of any number.
If virtual → same concept, but instead of location, the top line is Date + #slots.

Example:

💻 May 27 .......... 2 slots
    2: 00 PM • 30 min  ⬇️
         $450 [Request]
    6: 00 PM • 45 min  ⬇️
         $600 [Request]


---

3. Visual Language

Every expansion should feel like peeling a card layer — gentle lift animation, maybe frosted glass background.

Prices fade in subtly, not pop up like a sales tag.

The “Request” button should look like an invitation, not a checkout.

Use whitespace and spacing to make it breathe — premium design hates clutter.



---

4. Section Below

“Highlights” carousel (press, projects, awards) — quick, visual, swipeable.

Testimonials or “Memorable moments” with fans (if you want social proof without cheapening exclusivity).

#Tone and Result

When done correctly:

The interface feels cinematic, expensive, and calm.

The accent color exists as a presence, not a hue.

Buttons and CTAs guide, not distract.

The browse cards and profile pages look like different scenes of one film — same mood, different focus.



---

That is the directive.
Do not deviate, overcomplicate, or reinterpret design logic.
Unify first. Polish second. Maintain hierarchy and restraint.
